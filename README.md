# Analyzing Customer Churn in Excel
**_NB: You can download the Excel file and access the dashboard from the overview sheet_**

## Problem Definition
Using a fictitious churn dataset from a Telecom provider called Databel. I analyzed why customers are churning, or in other words, leaving Databel.

### What is Churning?
The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity.

## The Data
The Databel dataset consists of 29 different columns and has one row per customer.

## Data Preparation
- I checked for missing values and duplicates.
- I checked the structure and format of values within the dataset.

## Analysis
- Databel has a total of 6687 customers of which 1796 churned.
- The churn rate at Databel is at 26.86%. This is too high so we explored which types of users churn.

## Customer Analysis
- The top 3 reasons customers churn were:
1. Competitor made better offer
2. Competitor had better devices
3. Attitude of support person
- After analyzing the churn by churn categories, we found that the category driving the highest % of churn is Competitor. This suggests that competitors are coming in and taking Databel's customers with lucrative new telecom deals. We investigated further now that we have found the key problem.

## Demographic Analysis
- We then looked at Churn by demographics and found that Senior(elderly) individuals were more likely to churn with a churn rate of 38.22%.
- We further analysed the demographics by age group and found that customers aged between 79-88 only make up a small percentage of the customer base but had the highest churn rate. This might be expected as customers in this age range may pass away, but there may be other factors that are causing our customers to churn.
- We then investigated how the Unlimited Data Plan influences the churn rate. Customers who are on an unlimited plan are more likely to churn. Further analysis showed that customers who consume the lowest amount of data(Less than 5GB) are actually the most likely to churn at almost 35%.
- When we investigated customers churn rate based on how many months a person is a customer, we found that the longer one is a customer the churn rate decreases.
